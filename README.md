# JuliaSet
The famous Julia Set, coded in P5JS

## Three versions

- The Folder "JuliaSet" contains an array of fixed values for the Julia Set which I consider beautiful. Click the displayed Julia Set to display the next one!
- The Folder "JuliaSetMouse" contains a version which that lets you move your mouse around, calculating new Julia Sets on the fly, based on the X and Y values of your mouse!
- The Folder "JuliaSetSliders" contains a third version of the Julia set, combining both above projects: You have a slider for the X-Axis and a slider for the Y-Axis, and a "Calculate"-Button. If your PC is too slow to run the interactive "JuliaSetMouse"-Version, but you still want to input your own values, use "JuliaSetSliders"!

## More information
I also wrote [a blogpost](https://breaksome.tech/coding-the-julia-set-in-p5js/) about the Mandelbrot set, describing everything in great detail!

From the formula, and it's individual components, down to every single line of code used here. I described everything.

So if you want to learn more about the Mandelbrot Set, please visit  [this post](https://breaksome.tech/coding-the-julia-set-in-p5js/).

The  [Mandelbrot Set](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Mandelbrot) is very closely related to the Julia Set. Check out [this Project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Mandelbrot)
for the code, and  [this blogpost](https://breaksome.tech/coding-the-mandelbrot-set-in-p5js/) to learn more about it. It's a very extensive post, describing the Mandelbriot Set in great detail: What the Mandelbrot Set is, how it works, how each component of the formula works, and how to code it.

Turns out, the [Logistic Map / Bifurcation Diagram](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/LogisticMap) is also very closely related to the Mandelbrot set. Check out [this Project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/LogisticMap) for the code, and  [this blogpost](https://breaksome.tech/bifurcation-diagram:-coding-a-logistic-map-in-p5js/) to learn more about it.
