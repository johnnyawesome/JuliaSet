# JuliaSet
The famous [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set), coded in [P5JS](https://p5js.org/)

## Three versions

- The Folder "JuliaSet" contains an array of fixed values for the Julia Set which I consider beautiful. Click the displayed Julia Set to display the next one!
- The Folder "JuliaSetMouse" contains a version which that lets you move your mouse around, calculating new Julia Sets on the fly, based on the X and Y values of your mouse!
- The Folder "JuliaSetSliders" contains a third version of the Julia set, combining both above projects: You have a slider for the X-Axis and a slider for the Y-Axis, and a "Calculate"-Button. If your PC is too slow to run the interactive "JuliaSetMouse"-Version, but you still want to input your own values, use "JuliaSetSliders"!

## Links

The  [Mandelbrot Set](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Mandelbrot) is very closely related to the Julia Set. Check out [this Project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Mandelbrot)
for the code.

Turns out, the [Logistic Map / Bifurcation Diagram](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/LogisticMap) is also very closely related to the Mandelbrot set. Check out [this Project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/LogisticMap) for the code.
